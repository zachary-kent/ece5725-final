      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        We aimed to implement the classic mobile game of 2048 on the Raspberry Pi to be displayed on (and controlled by)
        the PiTFT. Further, it is clear that much of the future of embedded systems relies on cloud and IOT integration
        so that these devices can cooperate and communicate over long distances. To this end, we aimed for different
        players from arbitrary locations to compete and view each other's high scores, which would persist between
        different sessions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>For our final project, we decided to develop our spin on the
        classic game of 2048. In 2048, tiles labeled with powers of two are laid out on a 4 by 4 grid. You can shift all
        tiles up, down, left, or right until they collide with either another tile or the boundary of the grid. If two
        tiles labeled with the same tile collide, they are merged into a single tile, labeled with the double of the two
        individual tiles. You lose when the board fills completely with tiles and you can not make any other move to
        merge them. We aimed to implement 2048 so it was playable on the PiTFT and could be controlled using either the
        4 tactile buttons or swipes of the touchscreen. Further, we wanted the player's high score to persist across
        different sessions, and we also wanted each player to be able to view the high scores of other players playing
        on different machines. We implemented both the game logic and the GUI in Python (using the pygame library),
        while we implemented persistent high scores by recording this information in Cloud Firestore. Overall, we
        believe that we were successful in our goal of creating a fundamentally embedded system integrated with the
        cloud and IOT.

      <h2>Design & Testing</h2>
      <p>We took a top-down approach to designing our system, meaning that
        we broke larger systems into progressively smaller child systems. This allowed us to work independently on many
        aspects of the project, increasing our efficiency and the degree of “parallelism” to our workflow. Of course,
        these subsystems would eventually have to interact with each other, but we could instead “stub-in” lightweight
        interfaces between them to be implemented later. Being forced to develop these subsystems also allowed them to
        be decoupled, so that the implementation of one could be changed without affecting the other. We decided to
        break down our application into 3 smaller subsystems: the GUI, the game logic, and the backend database. We will
        now describe the design and testing of each of these subsystems in detail.
      </p>
      <h3>Game Logic</h3>
      <h4>Design</h4>
      Our game logic for 2048 needed to encapsulate the abstract logic of 2048, including the positions of different
      tiles and how they are moved/merged when the board is shifted in different directions. To this end, we created a
      class “Board” which represents an abstract square board in 2048. Although a typical 2048 board is only 4 by 4, we
      parameterized this board over its side length so we could potentially support larger boards in the future. We
      represented a board using a matrix whose entries represent the values of the corresponding tiles. Then, we added
      methods to this class representing the different actions you would perform on a board while playing the game. For
      example, we added a <code>shift</code> method that would shift the board in a given direction. This was a
      non-trivial task,
      as the semantics for shifting tiles in a different direction are somewhat contrived. Further, we did not want to
      duplicate code for shifting the board in different directions, as this would make the code more difficult to
      maintain and fragile to change; the code for shifting the board in different directions would be fundamentally
      coupled depending on the semantics we had prescribed. In order to minimize code duplication, we decided to only
      implement the logic for shifting the board left; to shift the board in other directions, we could instead rotate
      the board, shift it to the left, and rotate it back. We developed the following rules for shifting the tiles in
      different directions:
      <ul>
        <li>To shift the board up, rotate the board 90 degrees counterclockwise, shift the board left, and rotate the
          board back 90 degrees clockwise</li>
        <li>To shift the board down, rotate the board 90 degrees clockwise, shift the board left, and rotate the board
          back 90 degrees counterclockwise</li>
        <li>To shift the board right, rotate the board 180 degrees counterclockwise, shift the board left, and rotate
          the board back 180 degrees clockwise</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then, to complete the implementation of shifting the board, all that remained was to implement the
        functionality for shifting the board left. We “reverse-engineered” the semantics of shifting a 2048 board by
        playing 2048 online and recording how different edge cases are handled. This ensured that our game logic would
        match that of the original as closely as possible. Through this testing, we determined that shifting a row of
        tiles left adheres to the following rules:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>First, move all tiles in a row left as far as possible until they are all adjacent.</li>
        <li>Merge adjacent tiles of equal value into one of double value left to right. Tiles that were already merged
          into a tile of larger value should not be merged again.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Because every row was represented as an array of tiles, this algorithm could be implemented using a simple
        python loop where we considered adjacent tiles by inspecting tiles at indices <i>i</i> and <i>i</i> + 1 for
        <i>i</i> = 0..<i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> denotes the side length of the board. To avoid implementing tedious
        matrix rotations ourselves, we decided to represent the board using a numpy
        array, allowing us to use built-in numpy rotations. With the ability to shift a board left and rotate the board
        to an arbitrary degree, we were able to complete our implementation of <code>shift</code>.
      </p>
      <p>The other large component of the game logic included score tracking, which was also somewhat nontrivial to
        implement. Through empirical testing, we determined that every time you shift the board, your score increases by
        the sum of the tiles that are merged. In order to implement this logic, we compared the board before shifting
        and the board after shifting, flattening both into lists of tiles. Then, the score increase by shifting the
        board is equal to the sum of the tiles in the difference of the shifted board's tiles and the original board's
        tiles. This works because the only tiles that will be added to the board when shifting are those that are merged
        to create doubled tiles, and the total score increase is the sum of these merged tiles.</p>
      <p>Finally, we implemented the logic for when determining when a game has ended. After more empirical
        experimentation, we determined that you lose in 2048 when the board is full and you can make no move to merge
        any tiles. In order to compute this losing condition, we checked whether shifting the board up, down, left, and
        right resulted in no change to the board's contents. This completed our implementation of the game logic, which
        could then be accessed by the GUI using the <code>Board</code> class and its high level methods.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Testing</h4>
    <p>Comprehensive testing was critical to ensure the correctness of both the game logic and our application as a
      whole. Uncaught bugs in the game logic code would likely bubble up into the GUI to be viewed by the player. This
      would make them very hard to diagnose, as such a bug could have originated from any of our 3 different subsystems.
    </p>
    <p>In order to ensure that this did not happen, we employed thorough unit testing of our game logic, which was very
      amenable to assertion-based testing. For example, we wrote several unit tests that asserted shifting a particular
      board configuration in a specified direction resulted in the correct output board configuration. Unit tests are
      especially useful in testing the correctness of different edge cases, many of which we considered while writing
      the logic code itself. Having a fully automated test suite further allowed us to ensure that we did not
      inadvertently introduce any regressions into our code, which would have also been difficult to spot and correct.
      We wrote the unit tests themselves using the pytest framework, a very lightweight and well-maintained unit-testing
      framework for Python.</p>

    <h3>Backend</h3>
    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>Our backend needed to support accesses and persistent updates to users' high scores. Further, we needed to
      authenticate users so that a bad actor could not change another user's score. These two requirements are somewhat
      fundamentally coupled, as we need to save users' usernames and passwords in persistent storage. However, it would
      also be highly insecure to store users' passwords in plaintext in our database, as sensitive data would be exposed
      if our database were compromised. Additionally, we had to consider how the GUI would interact with the frontend,
      which presented the choice of whether or not to implement a serverless backend. Thus, implementing a secure
      backend was a non-trivial challenge; we now describe and justify the design decisions we made.</p>
    <h5>Traditional or Serverless?</h5>
    <p>Initially, we had wished to use a serverless backend; i.e. one where the GUI interacts with the database
      directly, as opposed to using a deployed API as a middleman. We elected to use Firebase, the serverless backend we
      were most familiar with. However, we almost immediately ran into issues when we learned that Firebase does not
      support desktop applications. This forced us to pivot to a more flexible server-based backend. In this scheme, we
      would write a REST API that would be deployed on a server; this service would accept and authenticate incoming
      HTTP requests and interact with the database on the requester's behalf. The GUI would then only interact with the
      database indirectly by making HTTP requests to our service, a much more flexible interface.</p>
    <h5>Language Choice</h5>
    <p>This approach came with other unexpected benefits as well. If we were to employ a serverless backend, all of the
      code for interacting with the database would have to be written in Python as well. One could imagine using an FFI
      to support multiple languages, but this likely would be tedious and error-prone. Instead, using a traditional
      backend allowed us to write our service in any language we wished, as this code would be completely independent
      from that of the GUI.</p>
    <p>With this freedom in hand, we decided to implement the backend in TypeScript, a statically typed superset of
      JavaScript. This allowed us to take advantage of the rich JavaScript web ecosystem while still enjoying the
      benefits of type-safety. Further, TypeScript has excellent support for asynchronous operations (implemented with
      the Promise API) that were extremely useful when performing high-latency network operations, like interacting with
      the database.</p>
    <h5>Authentication</h5>
    <p>Authentication is also an objectively difficult problem to solve with many reasonable solutions. As discussed, we
      needed to store users' passwords in some shape to ensure that users of the app can only login if they have the
      correct credentials. To avoid storing them in plain-text, we hashed the user's passwords before storing them in
      the database using the bcrypt algorithm implemented in the <code>bcrypt.js</code> library. Then, when we would
      authenticate a
      user's login credentials, we would hash the provided password and check that it matches the hashed password
      recorded for that user in the database. This does mean, however, that we were transmitting users' passwords
      directly from the GUI to the service. We prevented an attacker from intercepting users' plaintext passwords by
      using the HTTPS protocol to ensure that this network traffic was encrypted.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we wanted to avoid sending the users' passwords every single time they wanted to perform some
      privileged operation, such as updating their high score. The typical scheme to address this problem involves
      sending the user an access token once their login credentials have first been authenticated. Then, the user can
      include this private access token in future requests to perform privileged operations as opposed to repeatedly
      sending their login credentials. We decided to use JSON Web Tokens to tackle this problem. Given a secret key,
      JSON web tokens allow you to encrypt some information, such as a username, into an access token; this process is
      called “signing” the token. This token can then be decrypted to get this information back; this process is called
      “validating” the token. We applied this technology by signing a web token when a user first logs in and then
      sending it back to the user via an HTTP response. Then, when a user attempts to perform a privileged operation,
      like changing their high score, they must include this token in their request. The server then validates this
      token to ensure that the request is not impersonating another user. Overall, we were highly pleased with how this
      scheme allowed our authentication to be both secure and elegant.</p>

      </h4>
    </div>
    <h5>Interacting with the Database</h5>
    <p>Although we were not able to use Firestore on a desktop application, we still elected to use it as our database
      due to our familiarity with it. A Firestore database comprises a number of different collections, each of which
      can contain documents that store data or more nested collections. Because our use case is fairly simple, we
      decided that we would only need one collection called <code>users</code> that contains documents recording each
      user's data:
      their high score and password. We use the user's ID as the unique key for their document containing this data, as
      we maintain that duplicate usernames are not allowed.</p>
    <p>To implement functions that would directly interact with the Firestore directly, we had to use the Firebase Admin
      SDK, which was explicitly created for server-side use. This allowed our code to access Firebase using a “service
      account,” a secret key formatted as a JSON. We wrote different functions corresponding to the stateful actions a
      user would perform while playing the game. These included the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating an account. For this action, we implemented a function <code>register</code> that takes a username
        and password
        and creates a new document in the <code>users</code> collection identified by that username. We then record the
        user's
        hashed password and a default high score of 0 in the newly created document. If a document with that username
        already exists, then we throw an error.</li>
      <li>Logging in to receive an access token. For this action, we created a function <code>login</code> that takes a
        username
        and unencrypted password and returns an access token for that user, if their credentials are correct. We look up
        the user's document in the <code>users</code> Firestore collection to view that user's hashed password; we then
        verify the
        provided password using the method described in the Authentication section. If the user's account has not yet
        been created or the provided password is incorrect, then we throw an error.</li>
      <li>Retrieving a single user's high score. We developed a function <code>highScore</code> that takes a username
        and returns
        the high score of the associated account. To accomplish this, we just looked up the document in the users
        collection associated with the provided username; if it does not exist, then that user's account has not yet
        been created and we throw an error.</li>
      <li>Setting a user's high score. To implement this functionality, we wrote a function <code>setHighScore</code>
        that took a
        username and the new high score as arguments. We then looked up this user's document in the <code>users</code>
        collection
        and updated the property of that document that tracks the high score. Like in the previous function, if this
        document does not exist then we throw an error.</li>
      <li>Retrieving the top high scores. To implement a leaderboard, we needed to be able to retrieve the top high
        scores across all users. We developed a function <code>highScores</code> that takes an optional parameter
        <code>max</code> indicating
        the maximum number of high scores to be returned. This was an excellent use case for Firestore “queries,” which
        emulate functionality of SQL databases. Specifically, we created a query that would first sort the user
        collection in descending order by high score and then take the first <code>max</code> high scores. If
        <code>max</code> was not
        provided, then we just return all of the high scores ranked in descending order.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These functions comprised our service's interface to the database, allowing the service itself to interact with
      the database only indirectly through these functions. This allowed us to encapsulate the database itself; later,
      we could swap our database completely to something like MongoDB and just change the implementation of these core
      functions. Provided the new implementations still respect their specification, the users of these functions would
      not have to modify their code at all.</p>

      <img class="img-rounded" src="img/firestore.png" alt="Firestore" style="width:75%;">
      <h4>Figure 3: Firestore</h4>
    </div>
    <h5>API</h5>
    <p>Having decided that we would employ a traditional server-based backend, we now needed to settle upon a
      well-defined API (application programming interface) for our service. We created an endpoint for every user action
      described in the previous section, but no more; we wanted our API to be as simple as possible. We prescribe that
      the input information to each action must be provided in the request body, while the output of the action is
      returned through the response body. We wrote and generated the following documentation for our API using Swagger
      UI; it is also publicly available through navigating to the /docs endpoint. </p>
    <div class="center-block" style="text-align:center;">
      <iframe src="https://ece5725.herokuapp.com/docs/" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      <h4>Figure 4: Swagger documentation of our API</h4>
    </div>
    <h5>Service Implementation</h5>
    <p>Having made all of these design decisions, we were now ready to actually implement our backend in TypeScript. We
      decided to use the Express framework to generate routes for our service, which is probably the most common and
      well-maintained solution available. We first created an instance of an Express application and then attached
      different routes to it; an Express instance has a method for each type of HTTP request. These methods accept both
      the literal route itself and a callback that will be called when that request to the route is made. This callback
      accepts both the HTTP request and the HTTP response instance. Translating our OpenAPI specification into a
      functional express application was not difficult once we had fully planned out every endpoint we needed to create.
      As described in the previous section, every endpoint corresponds almost exactly to a single core function that
      interacts with the database</p>
    <p>When each of these endpoints are accessed, we will invoke the corresponding function developed in the previous
      section; for example, we would call the <code>login</code> function when the “/login” endpoint is accessed. In
      order to do
      this, the requester must include the necessary information in either the request body or query parameters when
      accessing an endpoint. Considering again the “/login” endpoint, the requester must include a username and password
      in the request body to pass as arguments to the <code>login</code> function. Then, we would send the result
      returned by this
      function (if any) in the response body with a 200 status code on success, a 400 error code if required information
      was not provided in the request body, and a 401 error code if we were unable to authenticate the user for a
      privileged operation. This completed our implementation of the service.</p>
    <h5>Service Deoplyment</h5>
    <p>We deployed our API using Heroku, which hosts our service publicly at https://ece5725.herokuapp.com/. Deploying
      with Heroku is fairly simple, although there was some setup involved. Firstly, as far as we know, Heroku cannot
      interpret TypeScript programs directly. This meant that we first had to compile our TypeScript code to JavaScript
      using the <code>tsc</code> compiler that would be directly interpreted by heroku. In order to do this, we
      specified that
      Heroku should invoke the TypeScript compiler after building our package with a postinstall script. We also had to
      inject secret keys, including the Firebase service account and JSON web token secret key, into Heroku's runtime
      environment. Heroku offers excellent Git integration that allows us to deploy by simply pushing to a remote
      repository hosted by them.</p>
    <h5>Interface to GUI</h5>
    <p>The GUI needed to interact with the service by making HTTP requests to its various endpoints using the ‘requests'
      library. We wanted to, however, encapsulate our service similar to how we encapsulated our database. As we did
      before, we developed a lightweight wrapper around the actual HTTP requests to our service. We also wanted to
      encapsulate the authentication scheme we were using; forcing the GUI to explicitly pass around access tokens would
      have broken encapsulation. Overall, we aimed to design the interface to the GUI so that the service could be
      drop-in replaced with another backend solution, such as a serverless backend.</p>
    <p>This motivated us to develop a ‘User' class which represents an abstract user of 2048. The constructor of this
      class takes a username and password, makes a POST request to the “/login” endpoint with these credentials in the
      request body, and saves the resulting access token from the response body to the object's state. If the response
      from the endpoint is not 200, then this means the login failed, and the constructor throws a custom
      <code>InvalidCredentialsError</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Then, we added a <code>high_score</code> method to the User class that fetches and returns the high score of the
      associated
      user. We implemented this by making a GET request to the “/high-score” endpoint where the ‘x-access-token' header
      is set to the access token saved in the User instance's state. This demonstrates how we were able to successfully
      encapsulate the access token within the User class.</p>
    <p>Similarly, we developed a method <code>set_high_score</code> that updates a user's high score in the database. To
      implement
      this, we made a POST request to the “/high-score” endpoint including the provided score in the request body and,
      again, the user's access token in the ‘x-access-token' header.</p>
    <p>We also had to develop some functions that were not associated with a User instance. For example, we developed a
      standalone function <code>create_account</code> that takes a username and password as arguments and attempts to
      create an
      account with the given credentials, returning <code>True</code> on success and <code>False</code> on failure. The
      implementation of this
      function was fairly simple; we made a POST request to the “/register” endpoint with the provided username and
      password in the request body. If the response status code is 200, then we return <code>True</code>; otherwise, we
      return
      <code>False</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, we developed a function <code>all_high_scores</code> that takes an optional argument <code>limit</code>
      and returns at most
      <code>limit</code> top high scores, ranked in descending order. Again the implementation of this function was
      fairly simple;
      it makes a GET request to the “/high-score/rankings” endpoint. If the optional <code>limit</code> argument is
      provided, we
      also include this as a query parameter to the GET request. We then return the list of high scores from the
      response body. This completed the lightweight implementation of the interface between our service and the GUI.
    </p>
    <h4>Testing</h4>
    <p>Testing our service was imperative in ensuring that our endpoints functioned correctly. We made extensive use of
      Postman to test our API. Postman allows you to create and save HTTP requests to be run systematically at different
      times. This was especially useful when we were first developing our service and we were running it locally. We
      used Postman to make requests to port 8080 on our local machine before actually deploying it to ensure that we did
      not deploy broken code. We used our OpenAPI specification to guide the cases we tested; our documentation
      enumerated all valid request schemas for an endpoint and also different classes of invalid requests. This
      motivated us to test the following properties for every endpoint:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every valid request sends back the correct response with all required information in the body.</li>
      <li>Every invalid request sends back the status code specified by our OpenAPI documentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, we tested that a POST request to the “/login” endpoint with an existing username and correct
      password resulted in a response containing an access token. We then used this access token when testing other
      endpoints that required them to authenticate the user, such as a POST request to the “/high-score” endpoint. We
      also tested that omitting required information from the body of a POST request to the “/login” endpoint resulted
      in a 400 response, and providing invalid credentials resulted in a 401 response.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Overall, we were highly pleased with the outcome of our project; we were able to successfully develop a 2048
        game playable on the Raspberry Pi and found that every subsystem worked correctly. You could create an account,
        login, play 2048 using the tactile switches, and save your high score for viewing on a different device. Thus,
        we were able to accomplish all of our baseline goals and most of our stretch goals.</p>
      <p>However, we did encounter several issues along the way, some of which were difficult to debug. One particular
        defeating instance was when we first deployed the service to Heroku and it immediately crashed; this was
        especially confusing to us because we had extensively tested the service locally before deploying it. Upon
        viewing the logs, we found a cryptic error that stated the Firebase service account was invalid even though we
        had injected it into the runtime environment. Upon some debugging, we found that Heroku had injected it into the
        runtime environment as a raw string, which in hindsight was to be expected. This was, however, solved easily by
        parsing the service account injected into the runtime environment.</p>
      <p>While conducting local testing of our service, we also found that the response of the “/high-score/rankings”
        endpoint was incorrect; instead of returning an array of scores, it was returning an empty object. Upon
        debugging, we found that we were actually sending a Promise wrapping the scores in the response. This issue was
        again easily fixed by waiting for the promise to resolve with the scores before sending them in the response.
      </p>
      <p>Beyond these relatively minor issues, however, most aspects of our project were very smooth. We were able to
        quickly and effectively debug all issues we encountered, a testament to our thorough testing and documentation.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Overall, building 2048 to be played on the Raspberry Pi proved to be an insightful experience in building
        embedded systems integrated with the cloud. We were not able to gain experience with cloud integration in other
        labs in the class, so this project demonstrated that it was both relatively painless to achieve and extremely
        fruitful. Cloud integration opened up our project to limitless possibilities while also presenting many
        interesting design challenges. Tracking high scores was only one application of cloud integration; it would
        likely not be difficult to add other network-forward features. Further, we were pleasantly surprised with the
        effectiveness of our traditional server-based backend, as it allowed our systems to be even more decoupled than
        they would have with a serverless backend. Generally, we found that encapsulating different parts of our
        technology stack allowed us to isolate our different subsystems and write clearer code that interfaced between
        them. This allowed us in turn to be maximally productive; both of us could work on completely decoupled code.
        Had we not been able to do this, we likely would not have been able to accomplish all of our stretch goals. </p>

      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      <p>Now that we have added cloud integration to our 2048 game, there are many possible avenues of future features,
        both hardware and software-central. One of our stretch goals that we did not end up implementing was realtime
        competition between players on different devices. In this scheme, different players from remote locations could
        view each other's moves in real time and the first player to reach 2048 would win. This would likely be
        difficult to implement smoothly due to network latencies, but we would likely attempt to do so using the
        WebSockets protocol. In contrast to HTTP, communication via WebSockets allows you to send interrupt-style
        updates between the client and the server. The alternative would be to use HTTP polling to continuously check
        for updates, which is inherently inefficient. Both players could then use WebSockets to send and receive real
        time updates to the server.</p>
